      <h2>John 14:1–6</h2>
      <p>
        Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.  
        In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.  
        I go to prepare a place for you.  
        And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself;  
        that where I am, there ye may be also.  
        And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.  
        Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?  
        Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

      <h2>Psalm 121:1–8</h2>
      <p>
        I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.  
        My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.  
        He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.  
        Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.  
        The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.  
        The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.  
        The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.  
        The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
