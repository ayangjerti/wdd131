            <img src="images/profilePicture.jpg" alt="Picture of Ayang Jhetem" width="300" height="200">
            <p>Hello! My name is Ayang Jhetem, and I am a new but rather passionate learner of web development with a growing interest in using 
                technology to solve real-world problems. I am currently enrolled in WDD 131: Dynamic Web Fundamentals, where I am 
                strengthening my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I really enjoy the process of transforming ideas into interactive projects. I 
                value creativity and continuous learning
                In addition to my journey in web development, I am also a dedicated dentist with a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree. 
                I currently practice at Dental Plus, where I provide patient-centered care focused on proper diagnosis, effective treatment,
                and preventive dentistry. I like to think that my professional experience in healthcare has shaped me into a diligent, detail-oriented, and 
                compassionate individual, qualities that i believe has also enhance my approach to technology and innovation.</p>

            <h2>About My Country</h2>
            <img src="images/nigeria.jpg" alt="Beautiful view of Nigeria" width="300" height="200">
            <p>I come from Nigeria, a vibrant and diverse nation often referred to as the “Giant of Africa.” With a population of over 
                200 million people, Nigeria is celebrated for its rich cultural heritage, dynamic history, and significant influence across the 
                African continent. It is a land of over 250 ethnic groups and more than 500 languages, with the three major groups being the Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo, alongside many other communities that contribute to the nation’s colorful identity. This cultural variety is reflected in Nigeria’s music, dance, festivals, food, and art, which are recognized and celebrated around the world.
                Beyond culture, Nigeria is blessed with natural beauty and resources. From the bustling cityscapes of Lagos and Abuja to the scenic plateaus of Jos, the waterfalls of Erin-Ijesha, and the coastal shores along the Atlantic Ocean, the country offers diverse landscapes and experiences. Nigeria is also a major hub of creativity and innovation, being home to Nollywood, one of the world’s largest film industries, and Afrobeats, a music genre that has gained international recognition.
                Despite challenges with infrastructure, governance, and economic inequality, Nigeria remains a resilient nation whose people are 
                known for their energy, resourcefulness, and optimism. Nigerians excel globally in academics, business, sports, technology, and 
                the arts, carrying the spirit of hard work and determination wherever they go. I am proud to be Nigerian because it is a country 
                that, despite its struggles, continues to inspire hope, strength, and unity in diversity.</p>

            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I have a wide range of interests that keep me inspired and balanced. 
            I enjoy exploring creative outlets such as writing, music, and digital art, which allow me to express ideas and emotions 
             in unique ways. Playing music, especially the keyboard, gives me a sense of calm and creativity, while writing helps me 
                     reflect and share my thoughts with others.  

            I also have a passion for technology and gaming, where I enjoy problem-solving, strategic thinking, and teamwork. 
            Video games like Call of Duty and chess challenge me intellectually and provide opportunities to connect with people 
            from different parts of the world.  

            Additionally, I value volunteering and leadership through organizations such as the Boys' Brigade, which has shaped 
             my sense of discipline, teamwork, and service. Altogether, my interests fuel my creativity, strengthen my problem-solving 
            skills, and make me a well-rounded individual who enjoys learning, exploring, and contributing positively to the community.</p>
