            <p>Hello! My name is Ayang Jhetem, and I am a new but rather passionate learner of web development with a growing interest in using 
                technology to solve real-world problems. I am currently enrolled in WDD 131: Dynamic Web Fundamentals, where I am 
                strengthening my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I really enjoy the process of transforming ideas into interactive projects. I 
                value creativity and continuous learning
                In addition to my journey in web development, I am also a dedicated dentist with a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree. 
                I currently practice at Dental Plus, where I provide patient-centered care focused on proper diagnosis, effective treatment,
                and preventive dentistry. I like to think that my professional experience in healthcare has shaped me into a diligent, detail-oriented, and 
                compassionate individual, qualities that i believe has also enhance my approach to technology and innovation.</p>

            <h2>About My Country</h2>
            <img src="images/nigeria.jpg" alt="Beautiful view of Nigeria" width="300" height="200">
            <p>I come from Nigeria, a vibrant and diverse nation often referred to as the “Giant of Africa.” With a population of over 
                200 million people, Nigeria is celebrated for its rich cultural heritage, dynamic history, and significant influence across the 
                African continent. It is a land of over 250 ethnic groups and more than 500 languages, with the three major groups being the Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo, alongside many other communities that contribute to the nation’s colorful identity. This cultural variety is reflected in Nigeria’s music, dance, festivals, food, and art, which are recognized and celebrated around the world.
                Beyond culture, Nigeria is blessed with natural beauty and resources.</p>
