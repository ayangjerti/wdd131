            <img src="images/profilePicture.jpg" alt="Picture of Ayang Jhetem" width="300" height="200">
            <p>Hello! My name is Ayang Jhetem, and I am a passionate learner of web development with a growing interest in using 
                technology to solve real-world problems. I am currently enrolled in WDD 131: Dynamic Web Fundamentals, where I am 
                strengthening my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy the process of transforming ideas into interactive projects
                and value creativity, problem-solving, and continuous learning as I expand my knowledge in the digital space.
                In addition to my journey in web development, I am also a dedicated dentist with a Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) degree. 
                I currently practice at Dental Plus, where I provide patient-centered care focused on accurate diagnosis, effective treatment,
                and preventive dentistry. My professional experience in healthcare has shaped me into a diligent, detail-oriented, and 
                compassionate individual, qualities that also enhance my approach to technology and innovation.</p>

            <p>I come from Nigeria, a country rich in culture, history, and diversity. 
               Known as the “Giant of Africa,” Nigeria is home to vibrant traditions, beautiful landscapes, and resilient people.</p>
